# Networking Concept
### Mac address
- Media control access 
- It is physical address to identify the devices
- it identify the NIC of each divices (NIC--> Network identification card)
- ex:- ether 00:0c:49:0a:43:03
- Mac work in the second and third layer of the OSI model
- Specially it is related to the switches

### TCP --VS-- UDP
  #### TCP                 
  + Transmission COntrol Protocol
  + Connection oriented protocol
  + used in HTTPS/SSH/TelNet/SMTP/FTP
  + provide the more security and relailablity
  + it form one-to-one connection and it gurantee the complete delivery of data
  + Three way hand shake
  + SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK
  + it is slow due to three-way-handshake, it take time to complete and establis the connection 
  + Use port to establish the connection 
  + During hand-shake it acknowldge your machine to the requested server
  + contains the 20Byte packet

 #### UDP
+ User Datagram Protocol
+ Connection less Protocol
+ it provide the fast transmission 
+ Broadcast or multicast the message and the complete delivery of data is note guarnted 
+ Streamming on voice-over-io(VOIP), DHCP,DNS
+ Used for streaming the data like procast, video 
+ contains the 8Byte packet

### Comman Ports and Protocol

#### TCP
      PROTOCOL/SERVICE                            PORT'S
        FTP                                        21
        SSH                                        22

        HTTP/HTTPS                                 80/443   
        POP3                                       110
        SMB                                        139+445
        IMAP                                       143
   
#### UDP
      PROTOCOL/SERVICE                            PORT'S
        DNS                                        53  
        DHCP                                       67.68
        TFTP                                       69
        SNMP                                       161

### The OSI Model
+ Open Systems Interconnection(OSI)
+ Learn this mnemonic to to know the seven layer sequence
+ **Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away**
+ OSI seven layers are 
      
        1. Physical                               (P)Please
        2. Data link                              (D)Do
        3. Network                                (N)Not
        4. Transport                              (T)Throw
        5. Session                                (S)Sausage
        6. Presentation                           (P)Pizza
        7. Application                            (A)Away

+ OSI Model Explain [REF](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/osi-model/) [IMG](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/02/OSI-vs.-TCPIP-models.jpg.webp)

      Layers                                        For
      1. Physical --                               Provide the connection between computer and network, it includes physical datacable,server
      2. Data Link --                              Make sure the data-transfer is error-free between different node, when data packet arrive at network layer then data link layer(DLL) deliver that packet to the requested host using MAC address.
      3. Network --                                Transmitt the data from one host to other, in different netwroks.It also place the reciver/sender ip address in header of packet.
      4. Transport --                              Data packet referred as Segment, it is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of complete message without any error/packet loss.
      5. Session --                                Responsible for the establishing the session,maintaining and also ensure the security
      6. Presentation ---                          Data from application layer(layer 7) is extracted here and manipulate as per the required to transmit over network.
      7. Application ---                           Used by the end user software such as web browser and email clients.
     
#####   While Receiving the data from network model work from layer 1 --> layer 7
#####   While sending the data from machine model work from layer 7 --> layer 1

### Networks

+ IP address are work with the third layer of the OSI Model
+ There are two types of ip address 
	+ IPv4 : 192.168.34.123
	+ IPv6 : 23:s3:3w:34:dw:23:2d
+ In IPv4 each section after delimeter(.) is contain the 8 bits each (0 & 1)
+ The total of complete ip address is 32 byte.
+ the total in terms of the bits is 256 that is from 0 to 255.
+ There are many network around you and your system and all are having the very specific identity number that is known as IP address. 
+ Types of ip address in a network 
+ 
	| Class	| Start ip | End ip | Subnet Mask | Netwroks(max)  | Hosts(max) |  
	| ----	|	-------  | -----  | ------------| ----------|-------|
	|    A  |  0       |  127   | 255.0.0.0   | 126				|16,646,144 |  
  |		 B	| 127			 |  191		| 255.255.0.0 |  16,383		|15,024 |  
	|		 C	|	192			 |	223		| 255.225.255.0| 2097,151 | 254   | 

+ IP address in the binary format
	+		 11111111.11111111.11111111.0 == 255.255.255.0 
  +			== 192.168.15.
+ Some Standard Slash Network
	+	/24 Network
	+  |128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
