# 1.  Operating System[[OS]]   #os
   	1.  Paging :-->  *[IMAGE](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Translating-Logical-Address-into-Physical-Address-Diagram.png)*
		1. it eleminates the need of contiguos memory allocation
		2. have two main component and parts
			1. component -> page number(p) and frame number(d)
			2. parts 
				+ Logical address -> addres generated by the CPU {represented in bits} 
				+ Physical address -> physical location of a required data in a memory
	2. In the process of accessing any data from memory, that will be done by accessing the memory location twice 
		to remove this double accessing of the memory we use the TLB{Translation Lockaside Buffer}.
	3. TLB  --> It contains the page table entries that have been most recently used. *[IMAGE](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190225192626/tlb1.jpg)*
			1. it is a kind of cache memory resister of memory with there physical address
			2. TLB stored the frequently used data for high speed accessing 
			3. It consist of two parts 
				1. key or tag  :: like page number
				2. value  :: like frame number
			4. It consist of few data that is { frequently/ recently used data}
			5. If data not found in the TLB table then it will search in the page table for that data {TLB miss}
			6. Advantages 
			7. Disadvantages
			8. Terms 
				1. Hit Ratio{HR} --> successful search / total searches doen
				2. Miss Ratio{MR} --> HR-total searches done
				3. TLBT --> Time( complete TLB search )
				4. MAT --> TIme( time to acces memory )
		    8. Effective Access Time 
			    1. formula 
			        EAT = HR*( TLBT + MAT ) + MR*( TLBT + 2*MAT)		     
	4. Cache
