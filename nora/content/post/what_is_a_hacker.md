What is a hacker? What is a hacker _now_?

I recently found myself asking this question from a few different axes.
I wondered what the word meant to people who used it, and what made them different from people who didn't. I wondered why and how the word had mutated over time.

There's literature on the subject, which I'll get into shortly, but what I found most illuminating was simply asking the question online.
