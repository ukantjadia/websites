* [sbrain](https://github.com/NoraCodes/sbrain) - a 25-symbol programming language specification and VM implementation, in Rust.
* [MLeM](https://github.com/NoraCodes/mlem) - the Machine Learning Machine, a virtual machine designed as an ML target.
* [update-rate](https://github.com/NoraCodes/update_rate) - a low-overhead update counter for high-performance applications.
* [workctl](https://github.com/NoraCodes/workctl) - a set of higher-level abstractions for controlling concurrent/parallel programs.

### Graphical Applications

* [gDiceRoller](https://flathub.org/apps/details/codes.nora.gDiceRoller) - a GTK app that allows users to roll dice in simple or complex combinations. Created to teach how to [make](../tutorial/speedy-desktop-apps-with-gtk-and-rust/) and [package](../tutorial/packaging-desktop-apps-with-flatpak/) GTK applications with Rust and Flatpak.
* [RandomUA](/randomua/) - a WebExtension that changes your User-Agent string to a sensible-looking UA string which is different for every request.
