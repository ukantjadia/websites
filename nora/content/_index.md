## ðŸ“œ Writing
{{< details >}}
{{< summary >}}
I write about projects I work on and try to record and synthesize what I learn about tech,
society, and more.
{{< /summary >}}

I've written tutorials on [type systems](/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be done with them (for instance, [session types](/tutorial/session-types/)), [binary reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/), and application security topics like [embedding malware in PDF files](/post/pdf-embedding-attacks/).

I've also written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.
