      <title>What Is Rust&#39;s unsafe?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of misconceptions around what the unsafe keyword means for the utility and validity of Rust and its marketing as a &amp;ldquo;safe systems language&amp;rdquo;. The truth is a lot more complicated than a single pithy tweet can possibly sum up, unfortunately; here it is as I see it.
Basically, the unsafe keyword does not turn off the advanced type system that keeps Rust code honest. It only allows a few select &amp;ldquo;superpowers&amp;rdquo;, like dereferencing raw pointers.</description>

      <title>U2F Zero in Firefox</title>

      <description>I recently got a U2F Zero, a tiny (about 2 inches long) and cheap (about 8 dollars) device implementing the FIDO Universal Second Factor protocol. It&amp;rsquo;s open source, too, which is awesome.
I primarily use Firefox. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn&amp;rsquo;t support U2F out of the box; you have to enable security.webauth.u2f in about:config.
Once enabled, I tried to register it with GitHub. Unfortunately, it kept on failing, despite the little green light on the U2F Zero going blue.</description>

      <description>Linux cannot fall behind in hardware support. In fact, if we ever want to capture the desktop market, we have to race ahead.
A few days ago, I had an interesting and somewhat frustrating experience with a friend of mine. Their laptop was dying, so they asked me to give them some suggestions for a new one.
Their requirements were a computer with a display that was good for reading, enough power to be responsive and able to multitask well, and rapidly accessible storage, but not necessarily a lot of it.</description>
